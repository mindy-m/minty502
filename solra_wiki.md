# Why let and var and const?

(Answer: just use let)

```rust
// Statics and consts are SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:
static EVIL_EYE: Mutex<EvilEye> = Mutex::new(EvilEye::new());
const NUMBER_OF_EYES: usize = 2;

// Types are CapitalCamelCase:
struct HelloStructureMyOldFriend;
enum IveComeToEnumYouAgain;
type EvenThoughYouAreATypeAlias = i32;
enum EnumVariantsAre {
    Also,
    Types,
}

// Everything else is snake_case
fn everything_else();
```


```js
var x = 1;



let y = 2;



const z = 3;
// can't do this:
z = 4;






var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
function bleh() {
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
    if(true) {
        var x = 25;
        console.log(x); // 25
    }
    console.log(x); // 25
}
console.log(x); // 5


let x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
function bleh() {
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
    if(true) {
        let x = 25;
        console.log(x); // 25
    }
    console.log(x); // 10
}
console.log(x); // 5

# How big is an int?

Rust:
```
i8 // is 8 bits
i16 // is 16 bits
i32 // is 32 bits
i64 // is 64 bits
i128 // is 128 bits
isize // is big enough to hold any size OR pointer (and is a special type, so the compiler can see when you did it wrong)
```


PDP-7: 18 bit words, 9 bit characters
```c
int big_word; // 18 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 9 bits
char little_word; // 9 bits
```

PDP-11: 16 bit words, 8 bit characters
```c
int big_word; // 16 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
```

VAX-11: 32 bit words, 8 bit characters
```c
int big_word; // 16 bits
long int bigger_word; // 32 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
long long int biggerer_word; // 64 bits
```

PDP-10: 36 bit words, 18 bit addresses, 6 bit characters "PARIS "! :D
```c
//int big_word; // 36 bits
int big_word; // 18 bit half word
long int bigger_word; // 36 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 18 bits
char little_word; // 6 bits
```

MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2: 36 bit words, 36 bit addresses, 9 bit characters
```c
int big_word; // also 36 bits
long int bigger_word; // 36 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 18 bits
char little_word; // 9 bits
```

Intel 8088: 16 bit words AND addresses, 8 bit characters, but you can use Magic to do 32 bit math!
```c
int big_word; // 16 bits
long int bigger_word; // 32 bits! :D
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
```

Intel 80186 (or i186 for short, or iAPX 186 for not really any short and kind of weird): 16 bit words, 16+8-bit addresses, wait what MOVING ON 8 bit characters, and you can do 32-bit math!
// AKA "This asshole..."

// TODO: bitch about near and far
```c
size_t size_sized_word; // 16 bits
intptr_t pointer_sized_word; // at least 24 bits, = 32 bits
int big_word; // 16 bits
// OR!!!!
int big_word; // 32 bits
long int bigger_word; // 32 bits!
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
```

Intel 80386: 32 bit words, 32 bit ~~or also 16+8-bit~~ ~~or also 16-bit addresses~~, 8 bit characters, you can do 64-bit math... this is getting tiresome, why is this happening
```c
size_t size_sized_word; // 32 bits
intptr_t pointer_sized_word; // 32 bits
int big_word; // 16 bits
// OR!!!!
int big_word; // 32 bits, more often but still not all the time GOD DAMMIT
long int bigger_word; // 32 bits!
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
```

(somewhere in there)
```c
// We can do 64 bit math and it doesn't suck, but long is already 32 bit, so
// THERE IS NO PROBLEM IF WE ADD:
long long int biggerer_word; // 64 bits! (usually)
```

SPARC!!! 32 bit words, 32 bit addresses, 8 bit characters, you can do maths
```c
int big_word; // 32 bits
long int bigger_word; // 64 bits
long long int biggerer_word; // 128 bits
short int not_as_little_word; 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
```

skip literally two decades:

AMD Opteron: 64 bit words, 64 bit addresses, 8 bit characters, you can do ALL THE MATHS
```c
int big_word; // 32 bits because we're cool, but sometimes 16 bits because we're warm
long int bigger_word; // 32 bits
short int not_as_little_word; // 16 bits
char little_word; // 8 bits
long long int biggerer_word; // 64 bits
// I am kidding, thank goodness
//long long long int biggest_word; // 128 bits
```

Enter C99! ISO to the rescue! Let's have a standard:
```c
size_t size_sized_word; // we've had this for a while. big enough to hold the size of something. that big!
intptr_t pointer_sized_word; // Big enough to hold **any pointer**

int128_t biggerer_word; // 128 bits!
intmax_t biggest_word; // What is the biggest word? That big
// wait, why'd it hilight that different?
// uh oh, I think I feel a STANDARD coming on!

7-bit ASCII:
1. 00-1F: control characters
2. 20-3F: punctuation
3. 40-5F: uppercase
4. 60-7F: lowercase (and also one control character because fuck you)

6-bit ASCII:
1. 00-1F: uppercase
2. 20-3F: punctuation
```


so you're on a modern system
```c
float f; // this is an IEEE 754 32-bit float
double d; // this is an IEEE 754 64-bit float
```

Intel 8087 floating point unit: 32-bit single-precision, 64-bit double-precision, 80-bit double-and-a-bit-precision. (Actually only has 80-bit, but shhhhhhh) 16-bit data bus
```c
float f; // so let's do 32-bit, because it's IEEE 754 compliant! :3
double d; // so let's do 64-bit, because IT'S IEEE 754 compliant! :3!!
long double ld; // ... I guess since we do sometimes need 80-bit precision and we already have long int let's just do this it'll be fine.
// SEEEEEEE_EEEEEEEE_1MMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM_MMMMMMMM
```

Intel the other kind of floating point unit: 32-bit single-precision, 64-bit double-precision, 128-bit double-double-toil-and-trouble-precision. And it's actually IEEE this time. It's just all IEEE. And it actually has all of them this time. For real. this time.
```c
float f; // 32
double d; // 64
long double ld; // 128
```

Motorola 68881/68882: 32-bit single-precision, 64-bit double-precision, 80-bit double-and-a-bit-precision. 32-bit data bus
```c
float f; // 32-bit! :D
double d; // 64-bit! :DDDDD


// **NOTE:  Just don't use long double
//
long double ld; // 96-bit! WAIT WHAT THE FUCKâ€”

```

SPARC:
```c

double d; // 64-bit! Oh man it's happening, Sun knows where it's at!

# Why doesn't Rust have globals?

Let's pretend it does:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

fn thread_a() {
    x = x + 1;
}

fn thread_b() {
    x = x - 1;
}
// 4, because thread_b started executing first, and finished executing second
// 6, because thread_a started executing first, and finished executing second
// 5, because one started and finished before the other started
// 4 or 5 or 6 because the caches fought each other and everyone lost
// corrupted horribly because oh no memory consistency is hard

fn main() {
    std::thread::spawn(thread_a);
    std::thread::spawn(thread_b);
}
```

```js
let x = 5;
function thread_a() {
    x = x + 1;
}
function thread_b() {
    x = x - 1;
}

thread_a();
thread_a();
thread_a();
thread_b();
thread_a();
thread_a();
thread_b();
thread_a();
thread_a();
```

It doesn't though

```rust

fn main() {
    println!("global constant is: {}", GLOBAL_CONSTANT);
    println!("global static is: {}", GLOBAL_STATIC);
    // exactly as if we had written:
    println!("global constant is: {}", 1347689);
    println!("global static is: {}", GLOBAL_STATIC);
    // but what if:
    println!("global constant is: {}", &GLOBAL_CONSTANT);
